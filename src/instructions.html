	<h2>TEAM BUILDING EXTRAVAGANZA Instructions:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Make index.html merrier by adding something holiday themed to the page</li>
		<li>logo.png is absolutely positioned to be centered inside of &lt;body&gt; with a z-index of 1000, position your addition around it.  Memes and Dad Jokes 100% welcome.  Anything cheesy from DynamicDrive.com (or other js script sites) also welcome</li>
		<li>If you are doing something obvious, discuss in the slack channel to make sure it's not the same thing someone else is working on</li>
		<li>Commit your addition sometime Friday (or email it to Rex if you don't have VPN access and live far away)</li>
		<li>Enjoy a delicious beverage</li>
		<li>Do something fun for the holiday  (seriously, spend as much time as you want on this, but 15 minutes is totally fine)</li>
		<li>mobicintchristmas.com will be uploaded with the latest src over the weekend</li>
	</ul>
