	<h2>TEAM BUILDING EXTRAVAGANZA Instructions:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Make index.html M [err,eme] ier by adding something holiday themed to the page</li>
		<li>logo.png is absolutely positioned to be centered inside of &lt;body&gt;</li>
		<li>Memes and Dad Jokes 100% welcome.  Anything cheesy from DynamicDrive.com (or other js script sites) also welcome</li>
		<li>If you are doing something obvious, discuss in the slack channel to make sure it's not the same thing (or similar) someone else is working on</li>
		<li>Commit your addition sometime Friday (or email it to Rex if you don't have VPN access and live far away)</li>
		<li>Enjoy a delicious beverage</li>
		<li>Do something fun for the holiday (seriously, spend as much time as you want on this, but 15 minutes is totally fine)</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Notes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://mobicintchristmas.com">mobicintchristmas.com</a> will be updated with the latest src over the weekend</li>
			<li>This only needs to work in chrome, other browsers don't really matter</li>
			<li>The logo has a z-index of 1000, if you want to put something on top of it, keep this in mind.  It also is set to have a max-width of 75%, so putitng things to the left or right of it will be OK as long as you keep that in mind as well.</li>
			<li>This is already more complicated than I wanted it to be, have fun, so no more rules</li>
